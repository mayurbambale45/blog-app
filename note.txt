# Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

1. Make sure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
2. Update `backend/.env` with your DB credentials if they differ from defaults (User: postgres, Pass: mayur, DB: blogapp).
3. Run the initialization script to create the database and tables:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run db:init
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
